# Rusty’s Rules of Order

Rules and procedure for meetings, as adopted by Portland General
Membership Branch of the IWW.

Decisions are made by a majority vote of GMB members in good
standing. Cards will be checked at the beginning of each meeting.
Nonmembers may be seated by decision of the group, but may not
vote or make motions.

Meetings should be businesslike and efficient, lasting, in most
cases, no more than two hours. The tone should be one of mutual
respect. Insults and personal attacks will not be tolerated.

Members may speak only when recognized by the chair. When
speaking in the meeting, address the group as a whole. No private
conversations allowed during the course of the meeting.

## Agenda

The AGENDA follows this format:

- CALL TO ORDER
- CARD CHECK REPORT
- CHOOSE RECORDING SECRETARY
- READ AND APPROVE MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING
- REVIEW, AMEND AND APPROVE AGENDA
- ANNOUNCEMENTS AND COMMUNICATIONS
- REPORTS
- OLD BUSINESS
- NEW BUSINESS
- GOOD AND WELFARE
- ADJOURNMENT

Announcements, Communications, and Reports must be brief, or
submitted in writing. There is no discussion, beyond brief
clarification. No decisions are made, unless they are so obvious as
to require no discussion. If any discussion is required, the item goes
to New Business.

Good and Welfare should include a critique of the meeting, critique
of the chair, selection of next chair, time and place of next meeting.

Items under Old and New Business begin with the statement (or
restatement) of a main motion.

## Making a Main Motion

A Main Motion concerns business to be carried out by the group.
There may be only one main motion on the floor at a given time.

The motion is stated, beginning with: "I move that" The motion
should be clear and concise.

If the motion is not seconded it dies.

If the motion is seconded, it is repeated by the chair, to establish the
exact wording. The maker of the motion either agrees to the wording
or corrects it. The chair instructs the secretary to record the motion
and to read it back. When it has been read back, in exact wording,
from the minutes, the chair calls for discussion.

The chair begins discussion by asking if anyone is opposed. If not,
the vote is taken. If so, discussion begins with opposition.

Discussion goes back and forth between favor and opposition until
all relevant opinions have been heard. No member may speak twice
on a motion until each member that wishes to speak has been
heard. Possible exception to this rule would be to allow the maker of
the motion to explain and clarify. Members may not repeat a point
that has already been made. If someone else makes your point
before you get your turn, just say, "I pass," when called upon, or
that you agree with the previous speaker’s point.

A member may offer a Friendly Amendment during discussion. It
should be stated in exact wording. The chair asks the maker if she
accepts that amendment. If not, discussion continues on the original
motion. If the maker accepts the amendment, it is repeated by the
chair, agreed upon, recorded and read back from the minutes. Then
the discussion continues on the Amended Motion, which becomes
the motion on the floor.

The maker of the motion may Withdraw the motion at any time
before the vote.

The vote is taken when discussion is completed. The chair may call
for the vote (Call the Question) or a member may do so. Call the
Question is a Procedural Motion (see below).

The vote is taken, counted, and recorded in the minutes.

Before moving on, the motion must be implemented. Decide what is
needed to carry out the motion, who is going to take responsibility,
by what time, and when they will report back to the group. This
should be prearranged if possible.

## Procedural Points and Motions

Points of Procedure and Procedural Motions speak to the process of
the meeting. They are in order at any time and must be dealt with
right away, before going on with the meeting.

### Procedural Motions:

A Procedural Motion must be seconded and voted on by the group.
This should be done quickly, so as not to distract from the main
business at hand.

The chair may make a point of procedure, or suggest (entertain) a
procedural motion.

- To Table (includes when it is to be dealt with)
- To Refer (to committee or wherever)
- To Adjourn
- To Recess (take a break)
- To Overrule the Chair
- To Replace the Chair
- To Call the Question (call for a vote)
- To Censure (the group tells an individual member that her
behavior in the meeting is unacceptable and will not be
tolerated)
- To Expel (must be preceded by a motion to censure, except in
case of immediate danger. This motion expels the individual
from the meeting, not the organization.)
- To Call for a Straw Poll (this is a non-binding vote, to assess the
feeling of the group)

### Points of Procedure:

The maker raises her hand and speaks out: "Point of Procedure" (or
"Point of Order"). The chair must recognize the member
immediately.

The chair may rule on a point of procedure. The ruling of the chair
may be challenged by a member and put to a vote.

Point of Personal Privilege: It's too hot, too stuffy, can't hear the
speaker, etc.

Point of Procedure (or Order): This is a suggestion as to how to
carry out the business better. It is ruled on by the chair. The ruling
can be challenged and the point made into a motion. Don't get too
carried away here, please.

## The Chair

The Chair is elected by the group and has a mandate to carry out
the will of the group as regards the procedure of the meeting. The
chair speaks with the authority of the group, for the group.

The chair should get to the meeting early to prepare for the meeting,
set up chairs, etc. She should make up a proposed agenda that is
legible and visible to the whole room.

The chair cannot vote, make motions nor discuss motions. If the
chair really needs to do these things she must pass the chair on to
another member for the duration of that item of business. This
shouldn't happen very often.

The chair is to oversee the process of the meeting to insure that the
following criteria are met:

That the business moves along quickly. The chair must keep track of
the time. A timekeeper may be appointed by the chair if needed. A
meeting should take no more than two hours unless agreed upon by
the group. Time limits may be set on discussion as needed.

That the Agenda is followed. That each item of business is taken
care of.

That each member who wishes to participate is encouraged and
given that opportunity. That none dominates the meeting and
speaks excessively at the expense of the others.

That the meeting is carried out in accordance with the rules and
procedures agreed upon by the group.

That the process is clear, understandable, accessible and
transparent to the members.

That an atmosphere and tone of mutual respect is maintained. The
chair, in the name of the group, does not allow disrespect, insult or
personal attack in the meeting.

The chair may not take part in the business of the meeting. She can
and should offer suggestions for the sake of clarity and to move the
business along. The chair may suggest (entertain) a motion or
procedure.

The duties of the Chair should be rotated, but a member should
chair several times in succession, in order to learn and refine the
skill of chairing. The group critiques the chair at the end of each
meeting in order to improve that skill. The ability to chair a meeting
well is considered to be a basic skill and necessity, to be learned
and perfected by each member, over time, as a part of the work of
the organization.

## Minutes

Minutes are to be taken by the recording secretary, elected at the
beginning of each meeting. The minutes are to be clear and legible,
following the standard format. Minutes should be accessible to, and
only to, all members in good standing, and must be present at each
meeting. Minutes from the previous meeting are to be accessible to
the chair in order to make up the proposed agenda.

This is the Minutes Format:
- Date and place of meeting. Type of meeting (monthly branch
meeting, for instance). Number of members present. Name of
chair and secretary.
- Called to order- at what time.
- Cards checked.
- Minutes read and approved or amended.
- Agenda approved.
- Synopsis of reports. This must be brief. Longer reports may be
submitted in written form, for inclusion in the minutes.
- Old Business, then New Business, to be recorded as follows:
  - Name of member (maker of motion)
  - M/S (moved and seconded) : That we ...
  - (Motion stated in exact wording)
  - Carried or Failed (tally of votes - number Yes, number
    No, number Abstained)
  - Withdrawn, Amended to... (exact wording)
  - Tabled or Referred (to when or whom).
  - To be implemented how, by whom, by what time, and
    reported back by whom, when.
  - Example: James M/S: That we send $100 to the striking
    tap-dancers. Carried 23Y, 5N, 6A. Mike will write a check
    and mail it this week, and report back to the next branch
    meeting.
- Synopsis of Good and Welfare. Next chair. Next meeting time
and place.
- Adjourned - at what time.

These rules and procedures are to be made available to all
members. They will be amended and updated as needed, by
decision of the Branch.
